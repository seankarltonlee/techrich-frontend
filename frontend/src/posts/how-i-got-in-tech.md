# How I Got In Tech

In 2015 I was a temp. They told me that in three years my contract would be over. I thought to myself: “3 years? Who the hell wants to be a temp for that long?” Well, 2.5 years later and there I was. The job sucked, I got paid little, and I needed out. Desperately.

I’m writing this post because some of you are where I was. I hope that sharing my path can help.

To be clear, I did lab work. I did all the manual labor only for someone else to get credit. Those of you who have been temps know the feeling. I didn’t study my ass off in undergrad for this.

In a company that has more than 10,000 employees, I felt like I was just a pair of hands. No one cared what I thought. I was a cog that could be replaced.

I felt jealous of my full-time peers. I might have actually felt hate. But it was the eternal lack of recognition that broke me. I was done with the entire fucking industry. I figured that if I was going to switch, I may as well pick what’s going to offer the most earning potential. The time to go was now, and I couldn’t wait to rub it back in their face.

So I started applying to coding bootcamps. This was the peak bootcamp era. Six figure jobs GUARANTEED, in only 10 weeks! It seemed too good to be true, but I bit. I was willing to do what it took to make it come true. I was motivated.

I failed my first interview with Hack Reactor. Yeah I thought they just let anyone in too. If you’re curious what went wrong, I spent 30 minutes explaining what an if else statement was doing in an absolute frenzy. It was that bad.

So I started working more. Except this work was for my own benefit, not someone else who didn’t care about me. I’m not a morning person so I studied for 3 hours everyday after work, hit the gym, ate, and slept. That was my routine for 5 weeks.

I passed the interview. Then I passed another interview for App Academy! Then I applied to grad school for computer science! Then I got rejected again! From every school I applied!

Except one (phew). I dropped the bootcamps and went for grad school.

What I would urge you to take from it is this, have a bias for action. I stopped hoping that someone would offer me a full-time position. I stopped hoping that someone would recognize the quality of my work. I stopped hoping for something (anything!) good to fall into my lap.

I stopped hoping, and started doing - and I made sure to do it damn well.

I failed (a lot). I felt like I wasn’t good enough (often). And I will continue to fail and feel less than adequate. But the win is so sweet. Don’t let short term failures affect the action you take towards long term success. This series of (fortunate) events have completely changed my trajectory. I’m eternally grateful for it, and I want to give back.
