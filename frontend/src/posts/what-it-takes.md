I went from being an envious wet-lab grunt to an egotistical software engineer. I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the tactics here so you don’t have to waste years of your life in class.

Being a software engineer is about teachability and iteration. You have to be willing to learn, you have to keep trying when you fail. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple code is clean code. Tackle five simple problems instead of one big problem.

Simple also means reusability and abstraction. Don’t write new code to make HTTP requests when you can use a package. You think doing it yourself makes you a better engineer. It doesn’t. Keep it DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

Frontend engineering is a lot like backend engineering. Backend engineering is like any other type of engineering. The main differences are the languages used. The principles remain the same.

Choose a language that is well suited to what you want to create. Python is good for mathematics and machine learning. You’ll need HTML and CSS to make a website. Just starting? Learn Java.

Write short programs. Avoid doing too much at once. Engineers aren’t as smart as you think.

If you’ve built enough and struggled enough, you’ll notice that you can comprehend new technologies quicker. That’s how it works.

That’s it. You just learned 85% of what it takes. You’re welcome.
